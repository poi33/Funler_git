* spellbooks
- normal = 1 spell
- rare = 1 - 2 spell(s)
- legendary = 2
** spells
*** fireball (splash damage, fire, can ignite, pushback)
 - increase local regional temparature: 
   (higher temp = things are set ablaze easier, including the player)
   (if small room = fast temp increase, large room = almost no increase)
 - element [fire] can be resisted, and affected by stats (player and creature)
 - pushback affected by mass of creature (and player items / stats)
*** telekinesis
 - move self (levitation / flying + movespeed at the cost of mana)
 - 
   
* items
- swing damage? (some might not have)
- stat bonuses
** special qualities
- can be anything you can think of! (but needs balancing)
*** mana-born... or blood magic :p (health as mana)
*** lifedrain
*** mana exhilaration (2x movement speed, multiplied by mana / max_mana)
 - 0 speed at 0 mana
*** critical hit
*** extraordinary willpower (damage goes to mana at 0 hp)
  - force yourself to stay alive through the power of will! :D
  - your body is clinically dead at this point, and ceases to aid you.
  - lose all stats but intelligence
  - movement costs mana (and requires telekinesis)

* game mechanics
** items mean everything
 - they give you spells (through spellbooks), skills, stats... 
 - only thing they don't give you would be base stats (stats without items) & race traits!
** stats and leveling!
*** about stats
 - your stats are very simple! (also represented as floats)
 - a strength of 1 = the average strength of a healthy human
 - thus a strength of 2.5 would make you VERY strong compared to the norm! 
   (basically 2.5 is equivalent to a weightlifting champion!)
 - some items may for example require unhuman levels of strength to wield!

 - thus, 1 int = average intelligence of a human, 1 dex = ... average dexterity

 - so if your race is human, your stats all start at 1! (how simple!)

**** primary stats
 - strength
 - intelligence
 - dexterity
*** levels?
 - there are no levels! :D (well, there's an average of all your primary stats, and you
   can think of this as your level)
 - this average can be a good measure of mob strength
*** increase stats?
- there are 2 main ways of gaining stats
**** training (BASE STATS)
- think of this as training a muscle, you get stronger over time
- however, this can only get you so far (as a human anyways)
- at some point, more muscle mass is not going to be obtainable! (realism! :D)
- the stats gained through training will be referred to as BASE STATS, and
  are the ONLY stat not gained through items. 
- for normal humans these stats will not carry you through the whole game! 
  (maybe with extreme luck? kiting & dodging everything!)
- perhaps a sensible human maximum value for BASE STATS would be 2.5?
  aka, 2.5x as strong as a normal person (a weightlifting champion), 2.5x
  as smart as the avg. (250 IQ?? lol, why not!... like a savant??). 2.5x
  as dextrous as the avg? (dunno, maybe some acrobat from the circus or sumth, you
  know... like fitting into one of those tiny boxes! :D)
**** items
- item added stats will be crucial to succeeding on your quest! (or maybe there will
  be a race that can't use items! (needs good base stats to compensate))
** legendary items
 - always drop on death
 - feel overpowered (but somehow still balanced)
** dungeon crawler'esque
*** has the familiar dungeon crawler goal / objective:
 1. descend dungeons / stages / levels (increasing difficulity)
 2. get to final room
 3. retrieve special quest item
 4. return to surface
 5. win!

 - floors cannot be skipped

*** how is it NOT like a traditional dungeon crawler?
 - it's realtime, not turn / tick based
 - not gridlocked to tiles (squares, hexes... triangles :D)
 - has skillshots / free aiming with mouse
 - potential for multiplayer (tick based does not lend itself to multiplayer, but realtime does!)
